# Handoff — TASK-047 Tauri/GTK RustSec cleanup

- **Branch/PR**: `feat/task-047-tauri-gtk-rustsec-cleanup` / #35.
- **Phase**: SW-1 PASS → SW-3 PASS → SW-4 PASS (recheck) → **SW-5 PASS (recheck)** — both gates green.
- **Decision**: deferred risk acceptance via Apple-target-scoped `cargo-deny`; no
  product/source/Cargo/UI/IPC/capability/config delta.

## SW-4 recheck — PASS

- Pin `cargo-deny@0.19.9` (workflow = `deny.toml`/`tasks.md`/`ops-review.md`). Real scan
  evidence in `ops-review.md` §3 (Apple exit 0; Apple+Linux `ignore=[]` → 5 `unic-*` + 11
  Linux unmaintained; `glib` 2024-0429 via osv). `ignore` = exactly the 5 `unic-*`;
  gtk3-rs/`glib`/`proc-macro-error` out of `ignore`, target-scoped. Wording = 17 (12
  deferred + 5 accepted). OpenSpec strict / YAML / `git diff --check` PASS; Cargo/product
  diff empty. cargo-deny not rerun (not installed); accepted real 0.19.9 evidence + QA.

## SW-5 recheck — PASS

- SEC-001 closed: 5 Apple-present `unic-*` in scoped `ignore` (per-ID rationale + ACCEPTED
  block); gtk3-rs/`glib`/`proc-macro-error` (2024-*) NOT in `ignore`, target-scoped
  (tripwire intact); cargo-deny pinned 0.19.9.
- L2 clean: gitleaks 0; semgrep ERROR 0; trivy HIGH/CRITICAL 0; osv 17 advisories, max
  `glib` 6.9 (<7.0) — no CVE≥7. Scope `Cargo.{toml,lock}`/`src/`/conf/capabilities = 0 B.
- Gate exits 0 (osv cross-check: only the 5 ignored `unic-*` fire on Apple). See `sec.md`.

## SW-6 DOCS — PASS (2026-06-21)

- Gap: README lacked advisory gate section; version showed v0.6.2.
- Fixed: `README.md` version bump → v0.6.3; added `## Dependency advisory gate` section
  (cargo-deny 0.19.9, Apple-target scope, 17-advisory posture table, tripwire warning,
  local/CI command, reference to deny.toml + RELEASE.md for full inventory).
- No code change; config/docs only. RELEASE.md + deny.toml content verified correct.
- Changed paths: `README.md`.

## SW-6 Release — PASS (2026-06-21)

- Version corrected: v0.6.3 → **v0.7.1** (task-045 took v0.6.3; task-046 is v0.7.0).
- Root `RELEASE.md`: heading updated + compatibility matrix added.
- `README.md`: version bump to v0.7.1; advisory section references updated.
- OpenSpec gate artifact: `openspec/changes/task-047-tauri-gtk-rustsec-cleanup/RELEASE.md` created.
- All three required declarations present: deployment size **patch**, rollback **automated**, compatibility matrix.
- Signed tag `task-047/v0.7.1`: **NON-CRITICAL BLOCKED** — SSH signing key `/Users/kaikkonen/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` missing at runtime; role policy prohibits unsigned fallback.
- PR #35 promoted to **ready-for-review**: https://github.com/kaikkone4/vire/pull/35
- CI advisory gate: no `statusCheckRollup` yet (PR was draft; gate fires on PR push event).

## Route

SW-6 PASS → **merge-ready**. Janne merges PR #35. Tag `task-047/v0.7.1` to be created after merge (requires SSH key at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`).
